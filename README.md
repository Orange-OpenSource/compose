Compose. The Blockchain Management Tool.

Compose is an application that allows for the management of the lifecycle of Blockchain applications. This includes the design and deployment of these applications, as well as managing interactions with them. Compose can be deployed on various Blockchain networks (currently, Ethereum or Alastria). It is possible to directly design a smart contract within the tool and deploy it. Once deployed, a REST API is automatically generated to enable interaction with it (input and output).
